The test kit utilizes pairs of RX and TX signals generated by the control board (Arduino). These pairs are strategically assigned to individual connector pin location to minimize the risk of signal crossovers between another RX or TX lines.
The RX pins receive the transmitted signals and evaluate whether the wires are correctly positioned within the connector.


 - If the number of pins is odd-numbered, the test kit will prompt the user to verify whether the corresponding pin location contains a specifically colored wire, and then proceed to check the remaining paired pins.


- If the pinning configuration is incorrect, the test kit will notify the user to recheck the entire cable assembly for errors.
